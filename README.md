A game of murder death and killing. 

Kep points.

I intend for my game to be murder mystery survivor game. Where a town full of people all must try and survive... eachother. Basic idea of the game involes 8 people spwan in a town , some spawn a  villians and others protecters, then survivors. Villians will have a goal of killing everyone in town, protectors try and kill vilians and not kill anyone else, surivors simply try and not die. No one will know at spawn what class any other player is. 

The main things i want to build in this game are. 

-Map with rooms that have doors that open and close. 
-A turnbased step and action movement system , simular to fallout 1&2;
-Inventory system( only for 0-3) items,
-day and ngiht phase. 


I am not going to bother with many graphics in the beginng , My main focus is game play aspects.
